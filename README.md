Data Collection: A diverse dataset of textual data related to mental health is being collected. This will include social media posts, forum discussions, personal blogs, online support group conversations, therapy session transcripts, etc. The dataset which is being used in this project is from kaggle.
Data Cleaning:Remove Noise: Elimination of irrelevant or noisy data such as HTML tags, special characters, URLs, and non-textual elements.
Normalize Text: Standardize text by converting to lowercase, removing accents, and correcting spelling errors.
Feature Extraction:Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represent text as a matrix of word frequencies, ignoring grammar and word order
Model Training:Split the dataset into training and testing sets.Train the selected model(s) on the training data using the NLP-processed features.Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance.
Model Evaluation:Evaluate the trained model(s) on the testing set to assess their performance.
calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure predictive accuracy and robustness.
Interpretation and Analysis:Interpret the trained model to understand the importance of different features in predicting mental health outcomes.
Ethical Considerations:Consider ethical implications related to privacy, confidentiality, bias, fairness, and potential harm associated with mental health prediction using NLP.
